## Hey!

I'm a CS grad student @ UIUC. I did my undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering from VIT, Vellore. My interests in computer science are broad but I've worked on domains like blockchain, distributed systems, a variety of web applications, elasticsearch/NoSQL and occationally on AI/ML. I mostly program on Python, nodeJS and Java.
