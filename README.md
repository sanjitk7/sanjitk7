## Hey!

I'm a computer science graduate student at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I did my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology. I have broad interests in scalable computer systems, software development and artificial intelligence. I am currently looking for opportunities for Summer 2023.
